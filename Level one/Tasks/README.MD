# Robotics Level One Tasks



## Task One 

- Arduino project controls three LEDs according to [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-txvk0TSYPB7W-6MwdB7-Xh0uAj34Nc/view?usp=sharing) sequence.

- You can also open the whole project with the connections and code [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/bRgVc9YWBZu).

- Check the code [here](https://github.com/MAzewail/Robotics/blob/main/Level%20one/Tasks/Task_One.ino)

## Task Two

- The needed sequence has been shown in [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uflfkjlzHkKVJHWCIkGqZwpZXQj4I4kk).

- You can also open the whole project with the connections and code [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8L7NSxeU2il).

- Check the code [here](https://github.com/MAzewail/Robotics/blob/main/Level%20one/Tasks/Task_Two.ino)

## Task Three


### Problem definition:

- The needed sequence has been shown in [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WTJlXqOQOlCD7zqrFyaWGZdGXh_ywFgG).

### First of all there are two different solutions here:

* The first one is a bit advanced solution as shown [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ctfituKkpLr-copy-of-quiz-3-adv). 

* The second one is a normal solution as shown [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1mBmCYXdkq1)

- Check the advanced code [here](https://github.com/MAzewail/Robotics/blob/main/Level%20one/Tasks/Task_Three_Adv.ino)

- Finally the normal one [here](https://github.com/MAzewail/Robotics/blob/main/Level%20one/Tasks/Task_Three.ino)
